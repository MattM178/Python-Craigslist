# Python Craigslist
Python code to scrape Craigslist for apartment data

I modified this code from an online blog and made some updates. Chris Holdgraf is the original author. I made some updates to adapt from deprecated code and made changes to suit my local needs. Here is a link to his blog post with the original tutorial: https://predictablynoisy.com/craigslist-scrape

To get this running on your local machine you will need to configure the following:

1. Craigslist address, formatted thusly: http://(city).craigslist.org/search/apa - change the city to your city
2. the CSV filepath at the end. Edit it to a relevant file path for your system.
