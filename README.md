# Python Craigslist
Python code to scrape Craigslist for apartment data

I modified this code from an online blog and made some updates. I cannot relocate the creator of the original file, but if I find them I will update the readme and credit them accordingly.

To get this running on your local machine you will need to configure the following:

1. Craigslist address, formatted thusly: http://(city).craigslist.org/search/apa - change the city to your city
2. the CSV filepath at the end. Edit it to a relevant file path for your system.
